# 3D-Design-car-related-parts
In this repo I collect 3-D printed parts connected to cars and working on cars.

In this repo I store the source code files for openSCAD. I like the references to find the parts on thingiverse. There one normally will also find photos how they look printed.

## H4 LED holder

This are plastic parts to fix the H4 LED Light in the lamb. The fitting might still a bit tight on the other hand one wants the lamb to stay in its place and to be not able to move.
It fits for sure Phillips Ultinon Pro6000 HL but also some no name producers and mid also work for other producers. Check the legal requirements at your place.

## conus for tire removal machine

This is a conus to split tires from aluminum rims. Till now it was only tested, printed as a solid pice. 
That part is up to now in the prototyping phase but it was already used for some tires.
